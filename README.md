# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Predicting Heart Disease has become one of the most difficult challenges in the medical sector in recent
years. As per recent statistics, about one person dies from heart disease every minute. A massive amount of data was discovered for which data-science is critical for analyzing this huge amount of data. This project predicts heart disease using different machinelearning algorithms like logistic regression,  support vector machine, k nearest neighbor(knn), random forest etc. These machine learning algorithm techniques we used to predict likelihood of person getting heart disease on the basis of features (such as cholesterol,
blood pressure, age, sex, etc. which were extracted from the UCI Heart Disease dataset.
